LexInterceptor — Extend Lex to support over 100 Languages

At this moment Amazon Lex does not provide native support for:
1. Chinese text input.
2. Cantonese and Mandarin voice input.
3. Receive image or attachment file.
They are important features for most of our chat applications.
To resolve those problems, IVE students and I develop an opensource project LexInterceptor which integrates with third-party translation and speech API to extend Amazon Lex to support more than 100 languages and handle attachments.
